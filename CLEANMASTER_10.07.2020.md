# Cleanmaster status October 7th 2020

This software got onto my phone at some point before 2017, December 2018 is when I really opened my eyes to the world, and learned that I needed to delete Google Chrome and other Google Services, and try to distance myself from proprietary software creators (something I am struggling with to this day, but I have made progress) I have questioned how effective it is (there is a lot of debate on how effective it is, it seems to act like it does something, the Samsung my files app changes the available space upon use and goes down by up to 200 megabytes, but this app (Samsung Files) after further observation seems to be completely random when it comes to reporting how much space you actually have, even after deleting CleanMaster) and I have been using it (CleanMaster) to test its effectiveness. It appears to be useless, so I completely deleted it when I ran low on space.
